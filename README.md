# Crypton ðŸ¤‘

## My Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to learn about using Cupertino and Material Widgets in parallel and providing a different user interface depending on the platform.


## What I will create

I am going to make a crypto currency price checking app. By the end of the module, you'll be able to monitor your bitcoin investents on the move!

- How to loop through code using Dart for and for-in loops.
- How to use Cupertino Widgets in your app.
- How to check the platform your app is being run on to customise the UI for that platform.
